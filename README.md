This is the first Assignment for COSC 499 CAPSTONE class. It will contain simple coding exercises.

# Purpose of Feature 1
This feature is designed to create a box. This line is created from a user asked input. The program asks the user to input a character and a length in between 4 and 20. It then takes thiss information and creates a box of n < 20 length and height of the inputed character.

# How to use
Using an IDE you may simply use the output interface provided and simply answer the questions and view the output. If using a command line:
-You must set your directory using "cd / file location"
-Then use "python filename" to run the program.
-The command line instance will then act as a interactive program.
